			The Elver is a so-called glass eel, which is a young eel of about two years old. 
			Eels are fascinating animals that travel over half the globe and can reach a
			respectable age of upto 85 years. The life of an eel is not yet fully understood although eels
			have been studied for a number of years.
		</p>
		<p>
			As with many other animals on this planet, Eels are threatened by environmental changes,
			parasites and dams and other obstacles in rivers. About 20 years ago the number of Eels dropped dramatically, to 10-15% of their
			original levels. 
			Eels are of significant economic value for a number of countries. Because of decline in 
			Eel stock and rising demand the prise has risen to $1100,-/kg. in the past.

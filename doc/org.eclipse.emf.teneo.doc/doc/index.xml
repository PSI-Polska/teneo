			<title>Elver Persistency has moved to Eclipse.org as Teneo within EMFT</title>
			<p><strong>Elver persistency has moved to eclipse.org as the Teneo project within EMFT:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The elver.org website will remain the source for documentation of Teneo.</li>
			<li>The source code can be retrieved from Eclipse cvs. The new main java package name: org.eclipse.emf.teneo.</li>
			<li>Teneo/Elver is part of the EMFT build process, builds can be downloaded here: 
			<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/technology/emft/downloads/">EMFT Downloads</a> 
			(select the Teneo project in the listbox). For the Eclipse update manager use: 
			http://download.eclipse.org/technology/emft/updates/site-interim.xml.</li>
			<li>Support is given on the EMFT newsgroup: news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.technology.emft.</li>

			<title>Introduction</title>
				<p>The Elver project focuses on combining code, persistency and UI generation solutions. 
					Elver/Teneo Persistency implements persistency solutions 
					for generated Java objects by integrating code generation frameworks 
					and existing persistency technologies.</p>

			<title>EMF Persistency</title>
				<p>Integrating EMF with existing persistency solutions, combines the power of a 
					code generation framework like EMF 
				and the power of storage, caching and querying of sophisticated object-relational mapping and persistency software.</p>
				<p>EMF has been integrated with two persistency solutions:</p>
				<p><strong><a href="hibernate/index.html">Hibernate:</a></strong> The EMF - Hibernate integration (alpha status) supports
				persisting of basic EObjects, ELists with 1:n, n:m, one-way, two-way and contained relations. EMF Objects can be retrieved
			using HQL queries.</p>
				<p><strong><a href="jpox/index.html">JDO/JPOX:</a></strong> The EMF - JPOX integration (alpha status) supports
				all EMF and JDO 2.0/JPOX features. EMF objects can be persisted in most major relational databases and retrieved using an EMF resource approach or 
					advanced JDOQL queries.

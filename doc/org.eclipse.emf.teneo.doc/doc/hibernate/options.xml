		<title>Options to control OR Mapping and Runtime behavior</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>The options described here are all present in the <em>org.elver.store.PersistenceOptions</em> class. The constant names used 
		in this page all refer to this class.</p>
		<p>Options are passed to the HbDataStore using a Properties object which is set using the HbDataStore.setPersistenceProperties method.</p>
		<p>Boolean options can have the lower case String values: "false" or "true".</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.OPTIMISTIC</strong>: if this property is "false" then no version properties are added to the 
		mapping of EClasses. Default is "true".</li>
		<li>	<strong>PersistenceOptions.INHERITANCE_MAPPING</strong>: the default inheritance mapping strategy to use, this can be
		JOINED or SINGLE_TABLE, see <a href="inheritance.html">here</a> for more information. Default is SINGLE_TABLE.</li>
		<li>	<strong>PersistenceOptions.UPDATE_SCHEMA</strong>: if set to "false" then the database schema is not updated 
		when initializing a HbDataStore. This improves startup times. Default is "true".</li>
		<li>	<strong>PersistenceOptions.FETCH_CONTAINMENT_EAGERLY</strong>: if set to "true" will set the fetch strategy of all
		containment references to EAGER. This means that containment relations are completely read in memory. Default is "false".</li>
		<li>	<strong>PersistenceOptions.SET_ENTITY_AUTOMATICALLY</strong>: if set to "false" then only EClasses which have an
		Entity annotation will be mapped. Default is "true", this means that all EClasses are mapped to the persistent store.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.QUALIFY_ENTITY_NAME</strong>: if set to PersistenceOptions.QUALIFY_ENTITY_NAME_NSPREFIX then
		all EClass names (used as entityname) will be qualified with the nsprefix of the EPackage. The nsprefix is prepended to the
		EClass name with a dot as a separator, for example: library.Writer. Note that all HQL queries should then use the 
		qualified EClass names.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.USE_MAPPING_FILE</strong>: if set to "true" then Elver will not do an automatic mapping of the
		ecore model to Hibernate but instead search for a hibernate.hbm.xml in the classpath of the EMF generated java classes.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.VERSION_COLUMN_NAME</strong>: can be used to set the version column name which is used
		to store the version of an object in case of optimistic locking. Default the version column name is e_version, however not all
		databases support _ in the name.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.ID_COLUMN_NAME</strong>: can be used to set the id column name which is used
		to store the id of an object. The id column is only added automatically if the model does not define a primary key for the
		type. Default the id column name is e_id, however not all databases support _ in the name.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.SET_CASCADE_ALL_ON_CONTAINMENT</strong>: as a default Elver will set a cascade style ALL on a 
		containment relation. This also enables dependent or orphan delete behavior. However it makes more difficult to support cut/paste
		operations using resources (see <a href="hibernate_details.html#cutpaste">here</a>). This option can be used to control the dependent or
		orphan delete behavior on a containment relation. If set to false then all cascade styles are set with  
		dependent/orphan-delete disabled. If set to true (the default) then all cascade styles are set including orphan-delete/dependent.
		</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.MAXIMUM_SQL_NAME_LENGTH</strong>: can be used to control the column and table name length. This is especially
		relevant in case the default annotation process creates foreign key columns or your property names are too long. 
		Foreign key column names are created by concatenating the name of the (e)class and the propertyname. The resulting name can be to long for certain databases. 
		By setting this option the system will truncate column names to this length. If the column/table name has a suffix (separated by a _) then the 
		system will truncate the part before the suffix.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.SQL_CASE_STRATEGY</strong>: controls if the table and column names are uppercased, lowercased or 
		no specific casing is done. The value lowercase will force lower case for all table/column name, the value 
		uppercase will force uppercase for all table/column names, none wil do not casing. It is also possible to set this
		option to the classname of a class implementing the org.elver.store.util.SQLCaseStrategy interface.</li>
		<li><strong>PersistenceOptions.DISABLE_ECONTAINER_MAPPING</strong>: this option (values: "true" or "false") controls if the container relations
		are mapped explicitly in the database, see also <a href="hibernate_relations.html#Storing+container+relation">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<title>Step 3: Retrieve and add EMF Objects</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		
		<p>In this part of the tutorial we retrieve the Library from the database back-end and perform some checks on and additions to the existing data.</p>
		
		<section>
			<title>Retrieve Library Object</title>
			<p>Obtain the Library we created in the previous step from the database:</p>
		<source>
final Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
session.beginTransaction();

// Retrieve the Library and its child objects.
// Note that you must use the EClass name in the query.
Query query = session.createQuery("FROM Library");			
List libraries = query.list();
Library library = (Library) libraries.get(0);</source>
	</section>
			<p><em>As noted in the source, you must use the EClass name in the query. (In most cases it's identical to the Java class name).</em></p>
		
	<section>
		<title>Perform some checks</title>
		<p>Now that we have a Library object, we obtain a few of its child objects and verify that we have the correct information.</p>
		<source>
// Obtain the Writer and Book
Writer writer = (Writer) library.getWriters().get(0);
System.out.println(writer.getName());
Book book = (Book) library.getBooks().get(0);
System.out.println(book.getTitle());

// Verify that the eContainer and references are set correctly. 
assert (book.eContainer() == library);
assert (writer.getBooks().get(0) == book);</source>
		<p>As expected, the objects retrieved from the database store comply to the ECore API. (EObject.eClass(), EObject.eContainer(), etc.)</p>
	</section>
		
	<section>
		<title>Add a new Book and Writer</title>
		<p>Now we add a new Book and Writer to the library:</p>
		<source>
// Add a new Writer and Book
Writer georgeOrwell = LibraryFactory.eINSTANCE.createWriter();
georgeOrwell.setName("G. Orwell");

// Create a new Book and set the Writer and Library.
Book georgesBook = LibraryFactory.eINSTANCE.createBook();
georgesBook.setPages(250);
georgesBook.setTitle("1984");
georgesBook.setCategory(BookCategory.SCIENCE_FICTION_LITERAL);
georgesBook.setAuthor(georgeOrwell);

library.getBooks().add(georgesBook);
library.getWriters().add(georgeOrwell);

// Commit.
session.getTransaction().commit();
session.close();</source>
	</section>	
		
			<section>
		<title>Next Step</title>
		<p>The next step of the tutorial shows some Hibernate HQL queries that retrieve EMF objects from the database.</p>

		<p>
			This tutorial describes how to store and retrieve a number of simple
			EMF objects. 
			This tutorial is based on the well known library example used in EMF tutorials:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/docs.php?doc=tutorials/xlibmod/xlibmod.html">here</a> for
				the EMF library example using a XML Schema</li>
			<li>Click <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/docs.php?doc=tutorials/clibmod/clibmod.html">here</a> for
				the EMF library example using a Rose model</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This tutorial assumes that you have done one of these two tutorials. The image 
			below shows the projects which should be present in the workspace.

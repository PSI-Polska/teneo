			<title>Add runtime plugin to dependencies of plugin.xml</title>
			<p>To enable the runtime layer the org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate plugin needs to be added to the
				plugin dependencies of the plugin.xml (see image below). <em>The org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate plugin
				should be re-exported.</em></p>
			<p>Your database JDBC driver should be added to classpath of the plugin and possible the packages
				of the jdbc driver have to be made visible to other plugins.</p>
			<p>Add the hibernate libraries to the model project and make the packages visible.</p>

			<title>Create Empty Database</title>
			<p>The runtime layer will automatically create tables and foreign constraints. However it will not
			automatically create a database. For this tutorial you need to manually create an empty
				database in your database server, the database should have the name: <em>library</em>.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Add Logging</title>
			<p>To view the log messages of Hibernate and Teneo you have to set the log4j properties. A
			simple sample log4j.properties file can be downloaded <a href="../samples/log4j.properties">here</a>.
			The log4j.properties file has to be placed directly in the src folder of the library model project.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Please click <a href="tutorial1_2.html">here</a> to go to the next step to create a library object and store it.</p>

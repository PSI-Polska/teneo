		<title>Tutorial: Using Hibernate in the EMF Editor</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>
			This tutorial gives an example on how the Hibernate EMF resource can be used in the 
			Library editor. This tutorial assumes that you have done the EMF library tutorial.
		</p>
		<p>To enable Hibernate support for the Library Editor a small 'bug' in generated editor code has to be repaired: 
			the generated editor allows the creation of
			invalid objects, e.g. a Library with an empty name. 
			Hibernate integration is more precise and will not allow this.</p>
		<p><em>This tutorial shows a 'quick-and-dirty' method to let the Library example work with Hibernate.
		The chosen approach is to make very small changes to the generated code and is not focused on an elegant or 
		optimal solution.</em></p>
		<p>The <a href="tutorial2_1.html">next step</a> of this tutorial describes these changes in more detail.</p>

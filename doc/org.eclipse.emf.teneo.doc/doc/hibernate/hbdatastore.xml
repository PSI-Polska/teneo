		<title>HbDataStore, HbContext and Runtime Options</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>This page describes the functionality of the HbDataStore and describes how different parts of the Elver runtime
		can be overridden by supplying your own specific implementation</p>
		<section id="HbDataStore">
			<title>The HbDataStore</title>
			<p>The HbDataStore object controls the persistence of a set of EPackage in a specific relational database. The HbDataStore
				contains a SessionFactory and is responsible for creating and updating the database schema.</p>
			<p>To create and initialize a HbDataStore, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create and register the HbDataStore using HbHelper.INSTANCE.createRegisterDataStore().</li>
				<li>Configure the EPackages to be handled by this DataStore using HbDataStore.setEPackages().</li>
				<li>Configure Hibernate properties for accessing the database. (Described
					<a href="tutorialone/tutorial1_2.html#Hibernate+database+configuration"> here</a>.)</li>
				<li>Call initialize() to build the Hibernate mapping and create the tables in the database.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can then obtain the Hibernate SessionFactory using HbDataStore.getSessionFactory().</p>
			<p>The HbDataStore can also be used to import and export xml and xmi through the importDataStore and exportDataStore
				methods.</p>
			<p>The HbDataStore has a specific method to retrieve all referers to a passed EObject: getCrossReferencers.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="hbcontext">
			<title>HbContext replaces ConfigurationFactory</title>
			<p>In the 0.3.* release of Elver the Hibernate Configuration could be changed/created using a ConfigurationFactory. 
			The ConfigurationFactory has been replaced by the org.elver.store.hibernate.HbContext in the 0.7.0 release. 
			The HbContext is set in the HbDataStore using the setHbContext method, as a default the HbContextImpl is used.
			The HbContext returns default implementations for Accessors, class names of Tuplizers and contains a method
			to create the Hibernate Configuration. You can extend HbContextImpl to override only specific methods.</p> 
		</section>
		<section id="overriding">
			<title>Overriding the HbDataStore</title>
			<p>In this release it is possible to override the HbDataStore with your own implementation. Next to the 
			specific implementation of the HbDataStore you also need to register a HbDataStoreFactory which creates this
			specific HbDataStore, the HbDataStoreFactory is registered through the HbHelper.setHbDataStoreFactory method.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="options">
			<title>Runtime Options</title>
			<p>Options are passed to the HbDataStore using a Properties object which is set using the HbDataStore.setPersistenceProperties method.</p>
			<p>The available options are all present in the <em>org.elver.store.PersistenceOptions</em> class. See the <a href="options.html">options</a>
			page for a complete overview.</p>
		</section>
		<section><title>Getting the Hibernate Mapping XML</title>
			<p>There are two methods to get to the hibernate mapping xml programmatically.</p>
			<p>The mapping xml which has been generated by Elver automatically (if no hibernate.hbm.xml file was specified explicitly)
			can be retrieved using the method: getMappingXML on the HbDataStore.</p>
			<p>The method HbHelper.INSTANCE.generateMapping(....) can be used to programmatically generate the mapping file.</p>
			<p>You can save the generated mapping xml to a file and then use that file. See the persistence option to tell Elver to
			use the mapping file, <a href="options.html">here</a>.</p>
			<p>The third method to get the hibernate mapping xml is by right clicking on an ecore file and select the appropriate
			Elver submenu option, see <a href="http://www.elver.org/hibernate/hibernate_details.html#orgeneration">here</a>. The
			disadvantage of this method is that it does not allow you to pass your own menu options.</p>

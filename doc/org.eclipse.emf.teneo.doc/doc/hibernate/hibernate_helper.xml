		<p>This page describes utility functions which are available in the 
		Hibernate runtime plugin.</p>
		<section id="CrossReference">
			<title>Retrieving cross referencers</title>
		<p>The HibernateHelper class offers a method for retrieving EObjects which
			refer to a specified EObject:</p>
		<source>
HibernateHelper.INSTANCE.getCrossReferencers(name, session, eobject);
		</source>
		<p>The first parameter is the name of the SessionFactory registered using the
			HibernateHelper.</p>
		<p>The second parameter is a session object. The caller of this method
		should ensure that a transaction has been started before calling getCrossReferencers.</p>
		<p>The third parameter is the EObject for which the referencers are to be retrieved.</p>
		<p>The method returns an array of EObjects which refer to the passed eobject. If 
			no referencer is found then an array with length zero is returned.</p>

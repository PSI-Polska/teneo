		<title>Supported (EMF) Features</title>

	<body>
		<p>
		The EMF - Hibernate Integration supports a number of important EMF features and features offered by Hibernate. 
		</p>
		<section id="supported">
			<title>Supported EMF Features</title>
			<ul>
				<li>Many relevant primitive types (including Date)</li>
				<li>Lists of primitive types (EDataTypeEList)</li>
				<li>Single Reference: contained, non-contained, one-way, two-way</li>
				<li>One-To-Many relations (EList): contained, non-contained, one-way, two-way</li>
				<li>Feature maps</li>
				<li>Notifications and adapters (limited testing done)</li>
				<li>Enumerations</li>
				<li>Resource implementation</li>
				<li>Lazy loading (similar to EMF proxy feature)</li>
				<li>Inheritance between types (limited testing done)</li>
				<li>No dependencies on EObjectImpl as root object or specific root object for persistency: EMF Objects are only required to implement org.eclipse.emf.ecore.InternalEObject</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="xmlschema">
			<title>Supported XML Schema structures</title>
			<p>EMF allows models to be expressed in XML Schema. Through EMF the current solution supports 
				many XML Schema structures, an overview:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Element definition with all combinations of minOccurs and maxOccurs</li>
				<li>Repeating model group such as xsd:choice with maxOccurs="unbounded"</li>
				<li>all relevant simple types including xsd:IDREF, xsd:IDREFS and xsd:anyURI</li>
				<li>etc.</li>				
				</ul>
			<p>For a detailed listing of XML Schema support see 
			<a href="features_details.html">here</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="ejb3">
			<title>EJB3/JPA Annotations</title>
			<p>The integration supports the following EJB3-like annotations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>UniqueConstraints</li>
				<li>MappedSuperclass</li>
				<li>IdClass</li>
				<li>OneToMany, ManyToMany, ManyToOne</li>
				<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For a detailed listing of EJB3 annotation support see 
			<a href="ejb3_features.html">here</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="hibfeatures">
			<title>Hibernate Features</title>
			<p>The integration supports Hibernate features such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>OR Mapping of class hierarchies, 1:n, m:n relations (one- and twoway)</li>
				<li>Support for many relational databases</li>
				<li>HQL query language</li>
				<li>2 level caching</li>
				<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="notsupported">
			<title>Not (yet) Supported EMF Features</title>
			<p>The following EMF features are (currently) not supported or have not been tested to ensure that they are supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>XML Schema constructions such as xsd:any, xsd:anytype etc.</li>
				<li>EMaps</li>
				<li>xsd:list, xsd:union</li>
			</ul>

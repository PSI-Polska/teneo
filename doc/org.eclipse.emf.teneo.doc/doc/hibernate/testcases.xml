		<title>EMF - Hibernate Testcases</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>The EMF - Hibernate integration is being tested using a number (currently > 70) of testcases. 
			Some testcases cover specific features such as one-to-many relations. 
			Other testcases cover specific error conditions. In addition a number of 
			EMF tutorials and examples have been added as testcases. 
		</p>
		<p><em>The EMF - Hibernate integration is currently tested using a subset of the complete testset. As new features are
			added to the integration more test cases will be enabled. </em></p>
		<p>Test cases are run using the following environment: Eclipse 3.2/EMF 2.2, jdk 1.4.2, Hibernate 3.1.3.
		Mysql 4.1.14 and SQL Server 2000 and 2005.</p>

			<title>Download test case project</title>
			<p>To run the test cases you need to download a number of related Eclipse projects. See the <a href="svn.html">Subversion</a> 
			page for download information.</p>

			<title>Configuration</title>
			<p>
				Before running the testcases you have to specify the database connection information in the dbadapters.properties
				file in the org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate.test project in the src folder. The properties are explained in the dbadapters.properties file.
				The test.properties file in the same folder determines which configuration is tested (for example which database and 
				which inheritance mapping strategy).
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the database driver specified in the dbadapters.properties file should be added to the project's
				class path (in project properties).

			<title>Run the testcases</title>
			<p>The org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate.test.AllTests class runs all testcases. More specific testruns are 
			available in subpackages of org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate.test.</p>
			<p>After you have done a test run, the system will store the generated hibernate.hbm.xml (for debug purposes) in the run directory of the 
			org.eclipse.emf.teneo.hibernate.test project.</p>

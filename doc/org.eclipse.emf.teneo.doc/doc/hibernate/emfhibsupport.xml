			It is possible that issues you may encounter are related to either EMF or Hibernate.
			We suggest that you first look in the documentation of the relevant website.
			If you cannot find the answer there, then you can try our <a href="mailinglist.html">mailing list</a>, 
			before turning to the support of these projects. We will do our best to also answer EMF or Hibernate specific 
			questions.

		<p>The source code of the EMF - JPOX integration is stored in Eclipse.org cvs here:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>host: dev.eclipse.org</li>
		<li>repository: /cvsroot/technology</li>
		<li>module: org.eclipse.emft/teneo</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>The source code in cvs is updated on a daily basis and contains experimental
				new features which can (temporarily) break already existing functionality and tests.
				There is no guarantee that the code in cvs will work in anyway.</strong></p>
		<section id="projects">
			<title>Projects in CVS</title>
		<p>The cvs repository has the following structure and projects:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>doc: contains this website</li>
		<li>examples: contains the samples and tutorial projects. Samples has all the model projects which are used as the basis for the test cases. The tutorial project contains the tutorials used on this website.</li>
		<li>plugins: this is the main folder. The following jpox related projects are present here:
			<ul><li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo: generic part of the runtime layer</li>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.annotations: the jpa annotations</li>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.eclipse: the generic part of the ui additions to eclipse for the Teneo right-click menus</li>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.jpox: the main jpox project containing the mapping logic, jpox annotations and runtime layer</li>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.jpox.eclipse: jpox specific part of the ui additions to eclipse</li>
			<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.libraries: common libraries (for example log4j).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>tests: contains the test cases:
			<ul>
				<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.commontest: this project contains the test case part which is common for jpox and JPOX</li>
				<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.jpox.libraries: jpox libraries, not distributed as part of the build, used during testing</li>
				<li>org.eclipse.emf.teneo.jpox.test: jpox test cases (junit)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition there are several feature projects and build related projects.</p>
		<p>We use the standard Eclipse code format with the line length set to 120, the formatter profile
		can be downloaded <a href="../download/elver-code-profile.xml">here</a>.</p>

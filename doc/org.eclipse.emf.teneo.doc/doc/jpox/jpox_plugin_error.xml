		<title>JPOX Enhancer Plugin known issue</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>
			There is a known bug in the JPOX Enhancer plugin for Eclipse 3.1. This bug can easily be solved by
			following the steps below. Note that this issue has been solved in the
			source tree of JPOX but not yet in the release. 
		</p>
		<p>To solve this bug please follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Goto the plugin directory within your Eclipse installation and goto the org.jpox.ide.eclipse.jdo_1.1.0.beta1
			directory.</li>
				<li>Open the plugin.xml with a text editor. Within the runtime tag in the top of the plugin.xml
				you will see two export tags. These need to be commented out.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So the following part of the plugin.xml:</p>
			        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
   <runtime>
      <library name="jpox-eclipse-plugin.jar">
         <export name="*"/>
      </library>
      <library name="lib/dtdparser.jar">
         <export name="*"/>
      </library>
   </runtime>
						]]></source>
			<p>needs to be replaced by:</p>
			        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
   <runtime>
      <library name="jpox-eclipse-plugin.jar">
         <!--<export name="*"/>-->
      </library>
      <library name="lib/dtdparser.jar">
         <!--<export name="*"/>-->
      </library>
   </runtime>
						]]></source>
	<p><strong>We noticed that after following the above steps we had to move the jpox plugin directory out of 
	the plugins directory, restart Eclipse, and then place the directory back and restart Eclipse again. 
	It is unclear why this was required.</strong></p>

  		<ul>
			<li>JPOXHelper has been renamed to JpoxHelper, its interface has been cleaned up, introduced concept of a JpoxDataStore,
			see <a href="jpoxdatastore.html">here</a>.</li>
			<li>FeatureMap support without generating additional source files, see <a href="featuremap.html">here</a>.</li>
			<li>The options which can be passed to the Elver runtime have been restructured, see 
			<a href="jpoxdatastore.html#options">here</a>.</li>
			<li>The previous annotations for inheritance mapping and unique have changed. see 
			<a href="inheritance.html">here</a> and <a href="jpox_details.html#Force+a+join+table+for+1%3An+relations">here</a>.</li>

	  	<title>Set the JPOX libraries for the JPOX plugin</title>
	  	<p>If a new version of the jpox libraries is present in the Elver distribution (see the
	  changelog) then you should also set the jpox libraries in windows>preferences to the new
	  jpox libraries. You can find all the required libraries in the org.elver.store.jpox.runtime[version]
	  plugin directory.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	  	<title>Regenerate package.jdo after upgrading</title>
	  	<p>New functionality and bug fixes can result in changes in the generated package.jdo.
	  New versions can depend on an updated package.jdo. So after upgrading it is sometimes 
	  necessary to regenerate the package.jdo file.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
      <title>Upgrade through the Update Manager: Search for upgrades... or Search for new Features...</title>
     	<p>Depending on how you defined valid upgrades in 
			 <em>windows &gt; preferences &gt; Install/Updates</em>, it is possible that
			 the 'Search for Upgrades of installed features' in the update manager will
			 not find the updated EMF-JDO plugin. If this happens then the 'Search for new Features..' option
			 should be chosen in the Update Manager.
		</p>
		<p>After the Elver plugins has been downloaded the 
			 update manager will detect that the 'new' feature is in fact an upgrade of an already
			 installed feature. The old-version of the feature will automatically be disabled.
			 This is visible in the Manage Configuration function in the <em>Help &gt; Sofware Updates</em> 
			 menu.
		</p>

    <section>
     	<title>Changed datamodel after upgrading</title>
		<p>The OR Mapper is also updated to solve issues and add functionality. This can mean that the 
			package.jdo generated by the OR Mapper differs from one version to another. Resulting in a
			different database schema. When the database already exists from previous versions this can mean
			that the new expected database schema does not correspond with the old database schema.
		</p>
		<p>JPOX will try to correct differences by adding tables and columns. However not all changes
			can be automatically repaired (for example missing columns which control the ordering in a EList).</p>
		<p>The issues can be resolved by manually adding missing columns. Another way to resolve the above issue 
			is to start again with a new empty database.
			JPOX will then automatically create new tables which adhere to the package.jdo</p>
		<p>For the longer term we are considering to offer tools which will better facilitate this upgrade process. 
			For example to allow data to be 
		copied from the relational EMF store to a temporary XML Resource, create the new database and
		schema and then copy the information back.</p>

		The EMF - JPOX Integration supports many EMF features and all features offered by jpox.

		<section id="supported">
			<title>Supported EMF Features</title>
			<p>The current version of the EMF - JPOX integration many important EMF Features. A summary:</p>
				<p></p>
			<ul>
				<li>All relevant primitive types (including Date)</li>
				<li>Lists of primitive types (EDataTypeEList)</li>
				<li>Single Reference: contained, non-contained, one-way, two-way</li>
				<li>One-To-Many relations (EList): contained, non-contained, one-way, two-way</li>
				<li>Many-to-Many relations (EList): contained and non-contained, one-way, two-way</li>
				<li>Notifications and adapters (limited testing done)</li>
				<li>Enumerations</li>
				<li>Resource implementations</li>
				<li>Lazy loading (similar to EMF proxy feature)</li>
				<li>Dynamic api</li>
				<li>Inheritance between types</li>
				<li>No dependencies on EObjectImpl as root object or specific root object for persistency: EMF Objects are only required to implement org.eclipse.emf.ecore.InternalEObject</li>
				<li>Support for EMF Feature Map as described <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf/docs/overviews/FeatureMap.pdf">here</a></li>
			</ul>

			<title>Supported XML Schema structures</title>
			<p>EMF allows models to be expressed in XML Schema. Through EMF the current solution supports 
				many XML Schema structures, an overview:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Element definition with all combinations of minOccurs and maxOccurs</li>
				<li>Repeating model group such as xsd:choice with maxOccurs="unbounded"</li>
				<li>Extension of complextype, from simple as well as other complex type</li>
				<li>Inheritance using abstract supertype and extensions from complextype</li>
				<li>all relevant simple types including xsd:IDREF, xsd:IDREFS and xsd:anyURI</li>
				<li>Mixed content</li>
				<li>etc.</li>				
				</ul>
			<p>For a detailed listing of XML Schema support see 
			<a href="features_details.html">here</a>.</p>

		<section id="ejb3">
			<title>EJB3 Annotations</title>
			<p>The integration supports the following EJB3-like annotations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>UniqueConstraints</li>
				<li>MappedSuperclass</li>
				<li>IdClass</li>
				<li>OneToMany, ManyToMany, ManyToOne</li>
				<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="jpoxfeatures">
			<title>JPOX Features</title>
			<p>The integration supports all JPOX features, e.g:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>OR Mapping of class hierarchies, 1:n, m:n relations (one- and twoway)</li>
				<li>Support for most relational databases</li>
				<li>JDO query language</li>
				<li>2 level caching</li>
				<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="notsupported">
			<title>Not (yet) Supported EMF Features</title>
			<p>The following EMF features are (currently) not supported or have not been tested to ensure that they are supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>EMaps</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="notjpoxsupported">
			<title>Not Supported by JPOX</title>

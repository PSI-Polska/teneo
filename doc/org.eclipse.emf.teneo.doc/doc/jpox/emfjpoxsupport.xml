			It is possible that issues you may encounter are related to either EMF or JPOX.
			We suggest that you first look in the documentation of the relevant website.
			If you cannot find the answer there, then you can try our <a href="mailinglist.html">mailing list</a>, 
			before turning to the support of these projects. We will do our best to also answer EMF or JPOX specific 
			questions.

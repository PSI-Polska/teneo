    <title>JPOX EMF Resources</title> 
    <notice>Describes the use of emf resource implemenations for jpox</notice>
    <abstract>From the 0.7.0 release the EMF-JPOX integration offers one type of resource: JPOXResourceDAO. It 
    		extends the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.impl.ResourceImpl.

      <title>Resource URI</title>
      <p>The integration layer automatically registers the JPOX resource for the 
		  protocol: jpox and jpoxdao. <em>The jpoxdao protocol is deprecated and present because of backwards compatibility.</em></p>
		 <p>From the 0.7.0 the EMF-JPOX integration offers one type of resource: JPOXResourceDAO. The previous JPOXResource is no 
		 longer used. The jpox protocol will from now return a JPOXResourceDAO instance.</p>
	  <p>The JPOX resource needs to know how to reach a data store. This is done by passing the name
	  of a JpoxDataStore to the resource with the JPOXResourceDAO.DS_NAME_PARAM parameter. The name of the 
	  JpoxDataStore is the name used when creating/registering a JpoxDataStore
	  using the JpoxHelper.INSTANCE object.
	  </p>
	  <p>An example of a URI which returns a JPOX resource: <em>jpox://dsname=MyPMF</em>.</p>

      <title>JPOX (DAO) Resource</title>
      <p>The JPOX DAO Resource (org.elver.store.jpox.resource.JPOXResourceDAO) starts and completes a 
		  transaction in the load action and reopens and commits a transaction for the save action.
		This behavior has the following consequences:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>A transaction is only open during the time of the load or save action and not in between.</li>
		  <li>After saving the resource the saved objects can still be used by the application, so no refresh
			  is required. </li>
		  <li>ELists are lazily loaded, primitive type fields and single EReferences are 
			  loaded when the resource is loaded. </li>
		</ul>
	</section>
      <section>
      <title>Validation</title>
      <p>The JPOX Resource automatically validates its content (the EObjects) when the
		  resource is saved. This validation makes use of the EMF validation framework through calls to
		  the Diagnostician.INSTANCE.validate method. Validation fails when a ERROR level Diagnostic is
		  encountered. In this case the resource save method will throw an org.elver.store.StoreValidationException. 
		  This exception has a method to retrieve all Diagnostics.</p>
	</section>
		<section>
	  		<title>Standard load behavior: Top level types</title>
      <p>When a EMF/JPOX resource is loaded (without using the query customizations) then only the so called top-level types are directly present in 
		  the resource contents. Top-level types are types which are not used as the 
		  the child in a containment relation. The assumption is that all contained types can be reached
	  from a top-level type.</p>
	  <p>See also the <a href="knownissues.html">Known Issues</a>.</p>

	 <section><title>Customizing load behavior</title>
	 <p>It is possible to customize what the resource actually loads from the database.</p>
		 <section><title>Extend the resource implementation with a Java subclass</title>
			<p>It is possible to customize the load behavior by overriding the loadFromStore method
				in JPOXResourceDAO. This method gets a PersistenceManager and should return a list of  
				objects read from the JDO/JPOX datastore.
			</p>
		 </section>
		 <section><title>Set specific queries to load the resource</title>
			<p>There are two ways to pass specific queries to the JPOXResourceDAO. The first method
				is using uri parameters:</p>
			 <p><em>jpox://?dsname=mystore&amp;query1=SELECT FROM org.eclipse.example.library.impl.WriterImpl</em></p>
			 <p>Two things are important here: 1) for JDO the query should fully qualified classnames to the concrete
			 implementation classes, 2) you can pass multiple queries by using parameter names which start with query, for
			 example query1, query2 etc.</p>
			 <p>The other way to pass queries to the resource are to specify them in the 
			 .ejdo file (see resource utility <a href="resource_utility.html">here</a>). An
			 example (commented out) of this can be found in the ejdo file <a href="download/library.ejdo">here</a>.</p>

	  		<title>Closing a resource</title>
      <p>The EMF/JPOX resource can be closed by calling the unload method. This method will close the 
		  used Persistence Manager.</p>

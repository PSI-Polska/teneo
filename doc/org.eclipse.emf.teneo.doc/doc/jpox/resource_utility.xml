		<title>Resource Utility: directly open an editor, import/export</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>As part of the EMF JPOX plugin install a separate utility is also installed.
			This utility can be used to directly open a relational JPOX controlled database in 
			the generated EMF editor.
		</p>
		<p><em>This resource utility is an alpha version and is in many
		ways very basic. It may or may not be usefull for you, it will be extended in the future.</em></p>
		<section><title>The ejdo file</title>
		<p>The resource utility operates on files with the extension <em>ejdo</em>. This file
		contains registration and database connection information for a Persistence Manager Factory.
		An example ejdo file with a description of its content can be downloaded here: 
			<a href="download/library.ejdo">library.ejdo</a>.</p>
		<p><em></em></p>
		</section>
		<section><title>Open Resource</title>
		<p>When rightclicking on an ejdo file the Teneo menu option is displayed. Within this 
		menu the option <em>Open Resource</em> is shown. Choosing this option will open a 
		EMF editor which reads its contents from the connection/session information in the
		ejdo file.</p>

		<section><title>Export/Import to and from XMI or XML</title>
			<p>The XML/XMI export
				function can be used to make a backup of your current data and import this again
				later in an empty database. The main drawback of the XML/XMI import is that it will add all the content to the database and will
			not check if the content already exists in the database. Note that the XMI
			export/import is more powerfull (than XML) because it supports export/import of multiple
			root objects.</p>
		</section>
		<section><title>Throubleshooting: empty editor when opening resource, can not add</title>
		<p>When you open an empty resource (relational database) by right clicking on the 
			ejdo file an editor is opened which does not allow you to add the first document. This
			is a restriction of the generated EMF editor. So you should always have at least one
			document in the resource. This document can be created by importing from a XML document
			or by using the standard EMF open model wizard.</p>
		</section>
		<section><title>Throubleshooting: editor does not start, AssertionFailedException</title>
		<p>See <a href="troubleshooting.html#Editor+does+not+start%2C+AssertionFailedException">here</a>
		in the troubleshooting page.</p>
		</section>
		<section><title>Future extensions</title>
			<ul>
				<li>Instead of a property file offer a more advanced ui</li>
				<li>Extend the export/import to support different modes such as 
					overwrite existing documents, add to the relational store etc.</li>
				<li>Support for xsl transformations when exporting/importing</li>
				<li>Export subsets of the relational store using HQL queries or other 
				filtering</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please post a message on the <a href="mailinglist.html">newsgroup</a> if you
			have other ideas or requirements for resource utilities.</p>

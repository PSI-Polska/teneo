		<title>Run the Library Editor</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>To run the Library Editor go to step 4 of the EMF Library tutorials (Run the generated Editor). For
			the EMF Library tutorial see:
			(<a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/docs.php?doc=tutorials/xlibmod/xlibmod.html">based on Rose</a>, 
			<a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/docs.php?doc=tutorials/clibmod/clibmod.html">based on Xml Schema</a>).</p>
		<p>After adding a Library and a Writer (JRR Tolkien) and a Book you need to save the resource. 
			The database mylibrary now contains a Library, a Book and a Writer.</p>
		<p><strong>Note that the model constraints are checked when saving EMF objects. Validation errors 
		(e.g. non-nullable fields are not set) are made visible in the Eclipse Error Log view 
		(see menu Window > Show View > Error Log).
		When one of the EMF objects is invalid then the complete save action is rolled back.</strong></p>
		<p>You can try the following editor actions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create Writers and Books, link them</li>
			<li>Link Writer to multiple Books</li>
			<li>Copy and paste of one or multiple Writers and Books</li>
			<li>Delete of a Book if it has no Writer</li>
			<li>Delete of a Writer if it has no Books</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cut and paste is not supported, see <a href="../jpox_details.html#cutpaste">here</a> for more information and a solution.</p>

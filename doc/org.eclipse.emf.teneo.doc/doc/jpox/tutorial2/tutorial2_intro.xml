		<title>Tutorial: Using JPOX in the EMF Editor</title> 
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>
			This tutorial gives an example on how the JPOX/EMF resource can be used in the 
			Library editor. This tutorial assumes that you have performed the 
			<a href="../tutorial1/tutorial1_1.html">generate jdo file</a> step of the Library tutorial and 
			done the EMF library tutorial.
		</p>
		<p>To enable JPOX support for the Library Editor a number of small changes have to be made to 
		the generated Editor and Model code of the library example:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Initialization: initialize the JPOX layer</li>
			<li>Repair small 'bug' in generated editor code: the generated editor allows the creation of
			invalid objects, e.g. a Library with an empty name. The EMF/JPOX integration is more precise and 
			will not allow this.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>This tutorial shows a 'quick-and-dirty' method to let the Library example work with the EMF/JPOX resources.
		The chosen approach is to make very small changes to the generated code and is not focused on an elegant or 
		optimal solution.</em></p>
		<p>The <a href="tutorial2_1.html">next step</a> of this tutorial describes these changes in more detail.</p>

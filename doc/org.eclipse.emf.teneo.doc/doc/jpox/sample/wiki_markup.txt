Emphasized
~~~~~~~~~~
An 'emphasized' phrase is a text sequence surrounded by '*' characters.

There should be a non-whitespace character after the opening '*'
character
and a non-whitespace character before the closing '*' character.

So if there are just some * stars * in the text, they are not recognized
as emphasized.
This is *emphasized text*, this is an *e*mphasized character and this is
a stand-alone *-character.
The * character can be escaped if necessary: \*this is not emphasized\*.

Strongly Emphasized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A 'strongly emphasized' phrase is a text sequence surrounded by '**'
characters.

There should be a non-whitespace character after the opening '**'
sequence
and a non-whitespace character before the closing '**' sequence.

So if there are just some ** stars ** in the text, they are not
recognized as strongly emphasized.
This is **strongly emphasized text**, this is a **s**trongly emphasized
character and this a stand-alone **-sequence.
The * character can be escaped if necessary: \*\*this is not strong\*\*.

Lists
-----
List items start with '-' or '*' characters at the start of the line. 
An empty line terminates the list.

- List item 1
* List item 2
  (List items may be continuated on the next line)

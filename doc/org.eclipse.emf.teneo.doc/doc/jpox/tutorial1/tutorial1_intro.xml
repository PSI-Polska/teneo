	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>
			This tutorial describes how to store and retrieve a number of simple
			EMF objects. 
			This tutorial is based on the well known library example used in EMF tutorials:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/docs.php?doc=tutorials/xlibmod/xlibmod.html">here</a> for
				the EMF library example using a XML Schema</li>
			<li>Click <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/docs.php?doc=tutorials/clibmod/clibmod.html">here</a> for
				the EMF library example using a Rose model</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This tutorial assumes that you have done one of these two tutorials. The image 
			below shows the projects which should be present in the workspace. In addition
			the JPOX Plugin and OR Mapper should be installed, 
			see the <a href="../installation.html">installation guide</a>.
		</p>
		<p>

			This tutorial will guide you through the following steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Generate OR Mapping file and enhance classes</li>
			<li>Add the runtime jars to the library model project</li>
			<li>Setup initialization code and create and store a Library with a number of Books and a Writer</li>
			<li>JDO query to read the library and its content</li>
			<li>Use an EMF resource to read the library and its content</li>
		</ol>
